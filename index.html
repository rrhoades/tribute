<p>Despite suffering horrific injuries when the Jedi betrayed us Lord Vader rose to be a symbol of strength and peace throughout the galaxy. Not much is known of his early life but since he appeared on the scene Lord Vader led our brave men and women to countless victories over the terrorists that threated to destroy our way of life. He had done everything from bringing dangerous Jedi to justice to leading negotions with world leaders that doubt the might of the Empire. </p>
<p>What no one would doubt is that Lord Vader is a deeply religous man who treats his faith with the upmost respect. He was also a general who leads from the front and was always a part of the action. Weilding his famous red lightsaber Lord Vader carved a swath through the enemies that hated our freedom. He even personally oversaw the capture of a dangerous smuggler.</p>
<p>Darth Vader was lost to us when our great peacekeeping station was destroyed over Endor. He spend his final moments protecting our emperor from these terrible terrorists. He may be gone but his legacy will forever inspire the Empire.</p>
